#' Code for completing the second carousel challenge during the
#' WHOI Summer Math Review session on R programming on
#' 16 August 2023.
#' 
#' Iâ€™ve been measuring the abundance of an invertebrate 
#' species in a local tidepool. 
#' I suspect the abundance might have an exponential distribution. 
#' My data are arranged as dates and abundance values.
#' How should I build an exponential model?
#' 
#' 
#' The data for this exercise is stored in `../data/carousel_2.csv`
