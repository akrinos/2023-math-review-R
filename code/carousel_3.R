#' Code for completing the second carousel challenge during the
#' WHOI Summer Math Review session on R programming on
#' 16 August 2023.
#' 
#' I have some data where I have two True/False values: 
#' whether it rained on a given day and whether temperature 
#' exceeded 80F. 
#' I want to plot a histogram of each distribution of values 
#' alongside a heatmap that shows the number of times these 
#' two events occurred simultaneously. How can I do this 
#' efficiently?
#' 
#' 
#' The data for this exercise is stored in `../data/carousel_2.csv`
