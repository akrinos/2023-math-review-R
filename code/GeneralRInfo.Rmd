# General R information

To save on time during this session, I've written the same notes that will be live-coded in class into this R Markdown file!

## Loading packages in R

Because `R` is an open community of data scientists, pretty much every interaction you have with `R` could involve loading some sort of package (though R's base functionality is uncommonly good).

When we load a package for the first time, we need to use:

```
install.packages("package-name")
```

For example, if we wanted to use the `ggplot2` package for plotting (like we will later today), we would use:

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```
If the package was not previously installed, we'll get some notes about where the packages were downloaded to and where they were downloaded from.

In order to use a package, whether we downloaded it today or sometime in the past, we use

```
library(<package name>)
```

Notice that we don't use quotations.
