# Welcome to the R WHOI Summer Math Review session!

This GitHub repository is yours to use and modify as you wish. Some of the
code has been added before class to guide some of the exercises we'll work on
today, 16 August 2023, and more code will be added during the course session,
including `RMarkdown` notebooks that we'll work on to create formatted
notebooks and graphics during the session

## Carousel Activities

1. The Arborist
  - In this exercise, students will learn how reading data frames into `R` can help perform bulk rote calculations, such as estimating tree age from circumference
  - In class, we will add some visualization practice to the end of the exercise
2. The Tidepool
  - In this exercise, students will be exposed to some of `R`'s built-in modeling capabilities, starting from the "humble" and powerful linear model
  - In class, we will try out a built-in forecasting package available in R for predicting extensions of seasonal, exponential trends in time-series data
3. The Rainstorm
  - Students will learn about plotting in `R` and about data manipulation using `dplyr`
  - In class, we will also learn about plotting these data in `ggplot2`
4. The Organizer
  - Students will learn about how to organize outputs in a notebook of code and text
